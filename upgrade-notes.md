# Upgrade notes

## Preamble

These items are necessary before we can actually start making any big changes.

1. Update to edition 2018 (update version number?)
2. Swap rustc_serialize for serde.
3. Use structopt.
4. Update csv lib/usage.
5. Cargo fmt.

## Logic/semantic changes

These items update the function of the program to be more in line with my current understanding of best practices and new additions to the language.
